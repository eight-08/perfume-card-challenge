## My process

### Built with

Only used HTML & CSS

### What I learned

This challenge was really helpful in grasping the basics of responsive design. I could've done the same stuff with bootstrap without any hassle but I chose not to, because I really wanted to understand the basics.

### Continued development

I am still not completely comfortable with the media query and responsive stuff, but I hope more of these challenges show up so I can continue learning and imporving.

### Useful resources

-- Stack Overflow.
